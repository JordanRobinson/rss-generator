# rss-generator
RSS generation application.

At present just a proof of concept, but the idea is:

 1. Take a static site, or a current RSS feed
 2. Create a new feed from the site or RSS
 3. Publish random articles from the site or RSS each day

Because randomnity is a nice quality to have, just like interesting RSS feeds.
